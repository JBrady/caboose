## Starters:
- What is SASS?
	- Sass is an extension of CSS3, adding nested rules, variables, mixins, selector inheritance, and more. Itâ€™s translated to well-formatted, standard CSS using the command line tool or a web-framework plugin
- What is Compass?
	- Compass is an open-source CSS authoring framework which uses the Sass stylesheet language to make writing stylesheets powerful and easy.
	- Compass:SASS::Django:Python
	- Compass:SASS::Rails:Ruby

## Things to show off about Compass + SASS:

- Mixins
	- border-radius
	- opacity

## Takeaways:

- SCSS > CSS
- SCSS is inviting, not intimidating
- Start low, end high. Nesting -> Mixins -> Variables -> Sprites
- Compass is language-agnostic
- You can use SCSS even in CSS projects
